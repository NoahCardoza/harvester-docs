Welcome to the harvester's documentation.

Check out the sidebar to read up on how things work around here. If you
notice, each entry has been numbered in the order that you'd most likely
need to understand them in.

If you have any questions feel free to DM me on Discord `@MacHacker#7322`
or join the Discord server by clicking the badge above.

## Status

Currently the Harvester is still under development but the beta will be
out soon. If you are interested in being a part of the beta, PM me over
